1. How many searches?
    Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 8.

        - 12 then 6, then between 6 and 11 is 8!

    Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 16.

        - 12 then 15, then looks between 15 and 18. Since 16 does not exist it should return null?
